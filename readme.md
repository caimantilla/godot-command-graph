Command graph plugin for Godot 4.1. Uses GraphEdit/GraphNode, with a basic implementation and way to add your own nodes.
I won't work on documentation for now, as any commands you make will probably be [incompatible with a future version of Godot 4.](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/67152) Also, I'm busy actually making a game.

This plugin requires a few functions from [my library](https://github.com/caimantilla/godot-cml), so it'll need to be included in your project as well.
